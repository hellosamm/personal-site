I found a really good carne asada recipe in [this book](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/asada-bricia-lopez/1141910928?ean=9781419762888). I updated it a little based off what we had at home and needed to write it down so I don't forget!

ORIGINAL RECIPE

- 1/2 c orange juice
- 1/4 c lime juice
- 1/4 c grapeseed oil
- 1 tbs apple cider vinegar
- 2 1/2 tsp worcestershire sauce
- 6 cloves garlic
- 6 oz dark Mexican ale
- 1 tsp ground black pepper
- 1/2 tsp Mexican oregano
- 1/2 tsp smoked paprika
- 1/4 tsp ground cumin
- 1/8 tsp ground cloves
- 2 tbs sea salt
- 2 lb flap steak
- 4 spring onions
- 1 c chopped cilantro
- 1/2 lg white onion
- 2 serano peppers

WHAT I HAD AT HOME

- 1/2 c orange juice
- **1/4 c lemon juice**
- **1/4 c canola oil**
- 1 tbs apple cider vinegar
- 2 1/2 tsp worcestershire sauce
- 6 cloves garlic
- 1 tsp ground black pepper
- 1/2 tsp oregano
- **1/2 tsp smoked chili powder**
- 1/4 tsp ground cumin
- 2 tbs sea salt
- 2 lb flap steak
- **6 green onions**
- 1 c chopped cilantro
- 1/2 lg white onion
- **1 jalapeno pepper**

Let steak marinate for at least 2 hours or overnight. Let steak reach room temp before cooking. Cook @ 450 for 4-5 min each side. Let rest 5 min after cooking. Slice meat against the grain and serve.

Not related to carne asada, but related to good things I've cooked lately. [This chocolate granola is delicious](https://beginwithbalance.com/homemade-chocolate-granola/). I've made it multiple times now!
