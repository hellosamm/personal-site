In typical sam fashion.. I decided that I needed a new zipper pouch for our upcoming trip. Rather than deciding this weeks or months in advance, I decided it needed to happen days before we left. So, I whipped out a new zipper pouch in the early hours of the morning (I also made one for my sister, per her request) & I've got to say they might be some of my best work yet. Next I want to experiment with making a zipper bag but with interfacing. I've currently been using a canvas-like material for the inside and I love the structure it gives the bags, but I ran out the fabric and need to come up with an alternative solution.

I also finally got to use some of the little tags I got for christmas! I'm a believer that tags do not belong in clothes, but they're fun for bags. Yes, I know it becomes wildly inconvenient when I want to re-order a shirt but I've cut the tag out and don't know what size to purchase. Or, when I wash a dress in the washing machine but it is supposed to be hand wash only... what can I say, I couldn't check the tag because.. well, I cut it out...

We also made the yummiest pizzas. [this](https://joyfoodsunshine.com/easy-homemade-pizza-dough/) has been our go to dough recipe so far, mostly because it's comes together so quickly & tastes delicious
