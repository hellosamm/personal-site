This week I made 2 batches of valentine’s quilt cookies, inspired by [@lauren_dozier](https://www.instagram.com/lauren_dozier/) She is the queen of quilt cookies! I made my first batch back in October but valentine’s seemed like the perfect reason to whip up some pink and red colored cookies!

I use [this](https://www.displacedhousewife.com/sugar-cookie-recipe/) cookie recipe (it’s a recipe I randomly found online & I’ve liked the results so I stick with it). The only note I have is that I add almond extract in addition to the vanilla!

I also found these corn cookies that look delicious & lots of quilt inspiration… is it time for me to sew another quilt??
