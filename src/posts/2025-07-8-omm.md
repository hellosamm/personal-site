For a long time, I chalked up my attitude toward learning and challenges to confidence or, a bit of delusion. I’d dive into things I didn’t fully understand yet, convinced I’d figure them out along the way. Sometimes it felt reckless, often times a little chaotic. But recently, I came across a snippet on growth mindset, and something clicked.

It turns out, what I thought was just stubborn optimism might actually be a mindset built for learning and resilience.

what a growth mindset looks like:

- I can learn anything I want
- Challenges help me grow

- My efforts and attitude determine my abilites
- Feedback is constructive
- I like to try new things
- Failure is an opportunity to grow

Seeing these written out made me realize that what I used to downplay as “being confident” is actually a powerful approach to learning and life. It isn’t about always being positive or never struggling. It’s about understanding that you can change, adapt, and grow over time.
