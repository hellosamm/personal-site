I'm slowly getting back into the groove after being gone for a few bit. I think I spent a solid 2 weeks catching up on sleep, but I'm back and ready to start making things again.

This week I started the beginnings of a new quilt! Mostly just picking out fabric, and let me tell you, it is extra hard picking out fabric online. I spent an absurd amount of time comparing colors and the best place to order from. But, on Saturday morning I submitted my order and am anxiously awaiting my fabric delivery!

One thing I've learned about myself is sometimes the planning and prepping takes so much creative and mental energy that when I get to the actual making I'm a little tired and I've really got to pump myself up to finish. So this time, I'm excited for a small break while I wait for the fabric to get delivered. It should give me a little bit of time to refill my creative tank.

My goal is to not overthink or over plan the quilt design which means minimal time spent building mockups.. which is not how I've done some of my other quilts, I usually spend hours in Figma messing with colors and designs. I'm going for a Gee's Bend inspired improv quilt, so it's been fun looking at images on Pinterest & seeing what elements I want to try. I've mostly quilted with squares and rectangles so I'm excited to give some of these a try!

It'll be fun to try so many new things and put them together as 1 finished piece. If I'm feeling brave I might have to try a [full circle](https://quiltingjetgirl.com/2016/02/09/sewing-full-circles-tutorial/)

Speaking of trying new things, as a teacher I often encouraged my students to try new things and to see them as exciting, rather than intimidating, and also reminded students that you donâ€™t have to be good at something to enjoy it. I noticed as an adult I like to stick to my comfort zone and I try a lot fewer things than I did as a kid, so I've tried to take my own advice. It's definitely easier to try new things in the comfort of my home without anyone watching, but I've been pushing myself to move past the discomfort and embrace the uncomfortable parts of trying something new.

I didn't try anything crazy this week, but I did cook (and eat) my first tuna steak! And I discovered a new cottage cheese combo- cottage cheese + flamin' hot cheetos. I think cottage cheese goes well with any salty, crunchy snack. It's like yogurt and granola's savory cousin haha! Pretzels are a good place to start especially the pretzel crisps, and PopCorners also pair well with a bowl of cottage cheese.
