_"how to propagate a pilea plant"_

I came home vacation and my cute pilea plant was all of a sudden growing sideways! It’s got a few “pups” as they call them & I’m wondering if it’s time for some propagating.. that being said, then I would need to buy soil and find 1, or 2 more pots and I’m not sure if/when I’ll get around to that.

speaking of plants, I’ve also been wanting to grow some outdoor flowers again. I grew zinnias and cosmos last summer & they were so fun to have! I told myself I’d start them in the winter (when it isn’t as hot) but… it’s almost march and I have yet to do that so again, not sure if/when I’ll make it happen.

_“how to get smoke smell out of leather”_

I found this cool leather bag thrifting with my little sister, however, when I brought it home phil quickly noted that it smells like smoke.. I thought it just smelled like thrift store 😂 I think it’s got potential. If I could eliminate the smokey smell, give it a nice leather conditioner, maybe a little polish.. do you polish bags or just shoes? ([this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Leathercraft/comments/z7b9t6/would_cleaning_conditioning_andor_polishing_this/?rdt=44578) might have some answers)

_“how to make stretcher bars”_

I recently came across the artist [Sydney Zester](https://www.instagram.com/sydneybeachzester.co/) & immediately fell in love. The idea of stretching textile pieces is kind of exciting, and makes me think of lots of new ideas.. maybe something with cyanotypes.

I’m a big fan of [@latesummerflowers](https://www.instagram.com/latesummerflowers/#) natural indigo quilts, and [these textile pieces](https://www.instagram.com/_monica__restrepo__/). Making quilts is fun but so time consuming. Even after you finish the top you have to line it, back it, quilt it, and bind it. If I can figure out how to easily make (or buy) stretcher bars I might be ready for some experiments.

I also came across [Rachel Carey George’s work](https://www.soulsgrowndeep.org/artist/rachel-carey-george) on one of my quilt searches & again, I am obsessed! I really need to make it back to MFA Boston or the Milwaukee Art Museum to see them in person! I could spend all day looking at [these quilts](https://www.soulsgrowndeep.org/gees-bend-quiltmakers), so many amazing artists!
