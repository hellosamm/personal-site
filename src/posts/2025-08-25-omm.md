Here's the thing.. about every 6 months I go to open a tab on my phone's internet browser and I get a notificiation that says "You have 500 tabs open. To open more, you will need to close some tabs" It gives me the option to close the tabs that are older than 1 month, but I can't bring myself to do it becuase what if I need to look at it again later.

I used to have this problem on my desktop too, but I recently made a bookmark folder called 'summer' and all summer long if there's a tab I don't need, but might want to look at later I'll add it to the folder. So it's there, but it's not _there_ if you know what I mean.

My goal is to clean up my phone tabs (can we get to 0?) and I figured I'd take some notes along the way, it's like a sneak peak into my brain
